# What Is Being Done?
As an editor, I will primarily be contributing content for our Guidebook. I have been assigned the "Hugo Chapter." We currently have three subheadings that I will explain ("Features" "Theme Directroy" and "Theme Files"). More may be added later. I will write a detailed explaning Hugo an unfamiliar reader. I will incorporate feedback from my fellow editors and add terms to our glossary. 

# When Is It Being Done?
I will try to a rough draft finished by mid-November in order to provide a placeholder as we develop the guidebook and in order to receive and adjust for feedback. I will have the revised final draft by the beginning of December, as a failsafe in case any final revisions need made. 

# How Will It Be Evaluated?
For my content, I think some guidelines for my colleague to consider are: 
CONTENT: (3 points)
Does the chapter accurately explain the concepts listed?
READIBILITY: (3 points)
Does the chapter explain the concepts in enough detail for a reader to get a good understanding, while being accessible enough for someone unfamiliar with the subject to undersand?
SPELLING/GRAMMAR: (1 point) 
Are there any glaring mistakes in the content? Does the content reflect a well-thought out work? 
PUNCTUALITY
Was the content completed at an accecptable time? 



# Who Will Evaluate It?
I am choosing Madeline Perry to evaluate me. As a fellow editor, she will know the standards by which the rest of our group's chapters achieve. And since I have discussed multiple prompts with her in class, I trust that she will know and be able to fairly assess the quality of my work.
